# Bike-AEB-System
Thomas Makin's 2019-2020 research project.
Using a LIDAR range finder, an Arduino, and two servo motors, a simple automatic braking system can be implemented in a consumer bicycle.

Project Status: Abandoned
Includes sketch for TF-Mini Plus LIDAR sensor and Arduino Uno, with dual servo motors directly driven by the board.
